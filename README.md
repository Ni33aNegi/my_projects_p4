ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali Sales Data

This project explores Diwali Sales Data to uncover patterns, insights, and customer behavior during the festive season.
Through a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Iâ€™ve analyzed key factors such as gender, age group, occupation, state, and purchase amount, to understand how different segments contribute to overall sales performance.

The analysis aims to answer business-driven questions like:

Which customer groups contribute the most to revenue?

How does purchase behavior vary by demographics?

What insights can help improve marketing and sales strategies?

Using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn/Matplotlib, this notebook provides a data-driven understanding of consumer patterns to assist in strategic decision-making.

ðŸ’¡ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw sales data

Perform detailed exploratory data analysis

Visualize customer and sales trends

Derive actionable insights for business growth

ðŸŒŸ Conclusion

The analysis highlights that:

Married women from the age group 26â€“35 years, particularly from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, form the most active buyers during Diwali.

Most purchases come from the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.

These insights can help businesses target specific customer groups, optimize marketing campaigns, and enhance product recommendations for higher sales.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how EDA transforms raw data into meaningful business insights, empowering companies to make data-driven decisions and enhance festive season sales strategies.

Would you like me to make this formatted in Markdown with emojis and headings (so it looks perfect on GitHub)?
I can also include a "Project Structure" and "How to Run" section for your README if you want it to look fully professional.
